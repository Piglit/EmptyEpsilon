<ul><li>addGMMessage(string message)<dd>Displays a dismissable message on the GM console.<br> Example: addGMMessage("Five minutes remaining!")</dd><li>addGMFunction(string name, <a href="#enum_ScriptSimpleCallback">ScriptSimpleCallback</a> callback)<dd>Defines a function to call from a button on the GM console.<br> The name is also used as the button text.<br> Use this to create helper scripts for the GM or give the GM console certain controls over the scenario.<br> These work only when added via scenario script, but not via the HTTP API. (#1807)<br> Example: addGMFunction("Humans Win", function() victory("Human Navy") end)</dd><li>removeGMFunction(string name)<dd>Removes a function from the GM console.<br> Example: removeGMFunction("Humans Win")</dd><li>clearGMFunctions()<dd>Removes all functions from the GM console.</dd><li><a href="#class_SpaceObject">SpaceObject</a>[] getGMSelection()<dd>Returns a list of SpaceObjects selected on the GM console.<br> Use in GM functions to apply them to specific objects.<br> Example: addGMFunction("Destroy selected", function() for _, obj in ipairs(getGMSelection()) do obj:destroy() end end)</dd><li>onGMClick(<a href="#enum_ScriptSimpleCallback">ScriptSimpleCallback</a> callback)<dd>Defines a function to call when the GM clicks on the background of their console.<br> Passes the x and y game-space coordinates of the click location.<br> These work only when added via scenario script, but not via the HTTP API. (#1807)<br> Examples:<br>   onGMClick(function(x,y) print(x,y) end) -- print the clicked position's coordinates<br>   onGMClick(nil) -- reset the callback</dd><li>setCommsMessage(string message)<dd>Sets the content of an accepted hail, or in a comms reply.<br> If no message is set, attempting to open comms results in "no reply", or a dialogue with the message "?" in a reply.<br> Use this only in replies (addCommsReply()), comms scripts (SpaceObject:setCommsScript()), or comms functions (SpaceObject:setCommsFunction()).<br> When used in the callback function of addCommsReply(), this clears all existing replies.<br> Example:<br> -- Send a greeting upon hail if the player is friendly with the comms target<br> function friendlyComms()<br>   if comms_source:isFriendly(comms_target) then<br>     setCommsMessage("Hello, friend!")<br>   else<br>     setCommsMessage("Who are you?")<br>   end<br> end<br> -- When some_ship is hailed, run friendlyComms() with some_ship as the comms_target and the player as the comms_source<br> some_ship:setCommsFunction(friendlyComms)</dd><li>addCommsReply(string message, <a href="#enum_ScriptSimpleCallback">ScriptSimpleCallback</a> callback)<dd>Adds a selectable reply option to a communications dialogue as a button with the given text.<br> When clicked, the button calls the given function.<br> Use this only after comms messages (setCommsMessage() in comms scripts (SpaceObject:setCommsScript()), or comms functions (SpaceObject:setCommsFunction()).<br> Comms scripts pass global variables `comms_target` and `comms_source`. See SpaceObject:setCommsScript().<br> Comms functions pass only `comms_source`. See SpaceObject:setCommsFunction().<br> Instead of using these globals, the callback function can take two parameters.<br> To present multiple options in one comms message, call addCommsReply() for each option.<br> To create a dialogue tree, run setCommsMessage() inside the addCommsReply() callback, then add new comms replies.<br> Example:<br> if comms_source:isFriendly(comms_target) then<br>   setCommsMessage("Hello, friend!")<br>   addCommsReply("Can you send a supply drop?", function(comms_source, comms_target) ... end) -- runs the given function when selected<br>   ...<br> Deprecated: In a comms script, `player` can also be used for `comms_source`.</dd><li>commsSwitchToGM()<dd>Switches a PlayerSpaceship communications dialogue from a comms script/function to interactive chat with the GM.<br> When triggered, this opens a comms chat window on both the player crew's screen and GM console.<br> Use this in a communication callback function, such as addCommsReply() or SpaceObject:setCommsFunction().<br> Example:<br> if comms_source:isFriendly(comms_target) then<br>   setCommsMessage("Hello, friend!")<br>   addCommsReply("I want to speak to your manager!", function() commsSwitchToGM() end) -- launches a GM chat when selected<br>   ...</dd><li><a href="#class_FactionInfo">FactionInfo</a> getFactionInfo(string faction_name)<dd>Returns a reference to the

("northwest") x/y coordinates for the given sector mame.<br> Examples:<br> x,y = sectorToXY("A0") -- x = -100000, y = -100000<br> x,y = sectorToXY("zz-23") -- x = -560000, y = -120000<br> x,y = sectorToXY("BA12") -- x = 140000, y = 940000</dd><li>victory(string faction_name)<dd>Sets the given faction as the scenario's victor and ends the scenario.<br> (The GM can unpause the game, but the

<a name="class_FactionInfo"></a><h2>FactionInfo</h2>
<div> A FactionInfo object contains presentation details and faction relationships for member SpaceObjects.<br> EmptyEpsilon has a hardcoded limit of 32 factions.<br><br> SpaceObjects belong to a faction that determines which objects are friendly, neutral, or hostile toward them.<br> For example, these relationships determine whether a SpaceObject can be targeted by weapons, docked with, or receive comms from another SpaceObject.<br> If a faction doesn't have a relationship with another faction, it treats those factions as neutral.<br> Friendly and hostile faction relationships are automatically reciprocated when set with setEnemy() and setFriendly().<br><br> If this faction consideres another faction to be hostile, it can target and fire weapons at it, and CpuShips with certain orders might pursue it.<br> If neutral, this faction can't target and fire weapons at the other faction, and other factions can dock with its stations or dockable ships.<br> If friendly, this faction acts as neutral but also shares short-range radar with PlayerSpaceships in Relay, and can grant reputation points to PlayerSpaceships of the same faction.<br><br> Many scenario and comms scripts also give friendly factions benefits at a reputation cost that netural factions do not.<br> Factions are loaded from resources/factionInfo.lua upon launching a scenario, and accessed by using the getFactionInfo() global function.<br><br> Example:<br> human_navy = getFactionInfo("Human Navy")<br> exuari = getFactionInfo("Exuari")<br> faction =

SpaceShips in turn belong to the CpuShip or PlayerSpaceship classes.<br> ShipTemplates appear in ship and space station creation lists, such as the ship selection screen on scenarios that allow player ship creation, or the GM console's object creation tool.<br> They also appear as default entries in the science database.<br> EmptyEpsilon loads scripts/shipTemplates.lua at launch, which requires files containing ShipTemplates located in scripts/shiptemplates/.<br> New ShipTemplates can't be defined while a scenario is running.<br> Use Lua variables to apply several ShipTemplate functions to the same template.<br> Example:<br> -- Create a ShipTemplate for a Cruiser Frigate-class CpuShip designated Phobos T3<br> template = ShipTemplate():setName("Phobos T3"):setLocaleName(_("ship","Phobos T3")):setClass(_("class","Frigate"),_("subclass","Cruiser"))<br> -- Set the Phobos T3's appearance to the ModelData named "AtlasHeavyFighterYellow"<br> template:setModel("AtlasHeavyFighterYellow")</div><dl><dt><a href="#class_ShipTemplate">ShipTemplate</a> ShipTemplate:setName(string name)</dt><dd>Sets this ShipTemplate's unique reference name.<br> Use this value for referencing this ShipTemplate in scripts.<br> If this value begins with "Player ", including the trailing space, EmptyEpsilon uses only what follows as the name.<br> If this ShipTemplate lacks a localized name (ShipTemplate:setLocaleName()), it defaults to this reference name.<br> Example: template:setName("Phobos T3")<br>Returns the object it was called on.</dd><dt><a href="#class_ShipTemplate">ShipTemplate</a> ShipTemplate:setLocaleName(string name)</dt><dd>Sets the displayed vessel model designation for ShipTemplateBasedObjects created from this ShipTemplate.<br> Use with the _ function to expose the localized name to translation.<br> Examples:<br> template:setLocaleName("Phobos T3")<br> template:setLocaleName(_("ship","Phobos T3")) -- with a translation-exposed name<br>Returns the object it was called on.</dd><dt><a href="#class_ShipTemplate">ShipTemplate</a> ShipTemplate:setClass(string class_name, string sub_class_name)</dt><dd>Sets the vessel class and subclass for ShipTemplateBasedObjects created from this ShipTemplate.<br> Vessel classes are used to define certain traits across similar ships, such as dockability.<br> See also ShipTemplate:setExternalDockClasses() and ShipTemplate:setInternalDockClasses().<br> For consistent class usage across translations, wrap class name strings in the _ function.<br> Defaults to the equivalent value of (_("No class"),_("No sub-class")).<br> Examples:<br> template:setClass(_("class","Frigate"),_("subclass","Cruiser"))<br>Returns the object it was called on.</dd><dt><a href="#class_ShipTemplate">ShipTemplate</a> ShipTemplate:setDescription(string description)</dt><dd>Sets the description shown in the science database for ShipTemplateBasedObjects created from this ShipTemplate.<br> Example: template:setDescription(_("The Phobos T3 is most any navy's workhorse frigate."))<br>Returns the object it was called on.</dd><dt><a href="#class_ShipTemplate">ShipTemplate</a> ShipTemplate:setType(TemplateType type)</dt><dd>Sets the object-oriented subclass of ShipTemplateBasedObject to create from this ShipTemplate.<br> Defaults to "ship" (CpuShip).<br> Valid values are "ship", "playership" (PlayerSpaceship), and "station" (SpaceStation).<br> Using setType("station") is equivalent to also using ShipTemplate:setRepairDocked(true) and ShipTemplate:setRadarTrace("blip.png").<br> Example: template:setType("playership")<br>Returns the object it was called on.</dd><dt><a href="#class_ShipTemplate">ShipTemplate</a> ShipTemplate:hidden()</dt><dd>If declared, this function hides this ShipTemplate from creation features and the science database.<br> Hidden templates provide backward compatibility to older scenario scripts.<br> Example: template:hidden() -- hides this template<br>Returns the object it was called on.</dd><dt><a href="#class_ShipTemplate">ShipTemplate</a> ShipTemplate:setDefaultAI(string default_ai_name)</dt><dd>Sets the default combat AI state for CpuShips created from this ShipTemplate.<br> Combat AI states determine the AI's combat tactics and responses.<br> They're distinct from orders, which determine the ship's active objectives and are defined by CpuShip:order...() functions.<br> Valid combat AI states are:<br> -

CpuShip's short- and long-range radar ranges to acquire targets, which can be affected by nebulae.<br> They also rank prospective targets by their type, distance, and capabilities.<br> Example:<br> --

<div> A SpaceShip is a ShipTemplateBasedObject controlled by either the AI (CpuShip) or players (PlayerSpaceship).<br> It can carry and deploy weapons, dock with or carry docked ships, and move using impulse, jump, or warp drives.<br> It's also subject to being moved by collision physics, unlike SpaceStations, which remain stationary.<br> This is the parent class of CpuShip and PlayerSpaceship objects, which inherit all STBO and SpaceShip functions.<br> Objects of this class can't be created by scripts, but its child classes can.</div>Subclass of: <a

<div> A CpuShip is an AI-controlled SpaceShip.<br> The AI can be assigned an order (be idle, roam freely, defend location, etc.) and a combat behavior state (attack at close or long range, be

CpuShip's short- and long-range radar ranges to acquire targets, which can be affected by nebulae.<br> They also rank prospective targets by their type, distance, and capabilities.<br> Example:<br> -- Place a Fighter-class Human Navy CpuShip, order it to roam, and if it engages in combat it will fight evasively<br> ship = CpuShip():setTemplate("Fighter"):setPosition(10000,3000):setFaction("Human
