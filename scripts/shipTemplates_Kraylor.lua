--Faction style (equipment):
--moderate hull, even on heavyer ships (Kraylors can survive hull breaches more easily than other species)
--strong shields, more shield segments (counts as pysical strength of the ship)
--heavyer beams
--moderate speed, no warp, heavyer ships may have jump
--homing missiles as standarg equipment. Heavyer ships have also HVLIs.

-- Equipment: Kraylor standard beams (short range), impulse speed: 60
rockbreaker_description = [[The Rockbreaker gunship is a spacecraft popular among Kraylor raiders. Since the Kraylor military got rid of those ships after the Ganymede slaughter, they are very cheap on the Kraylor second hand shipyards. These ships are not well equiped, but easily to repair.

The Rockbreaker is equiped with a central homing missile tube to do initial damage and then take out the enemy with 2 front firing beams. It's designed to quickly destroy single enemies weaker than itself. The shields of most human frigates will only last few seconds under the fire of a fully equipped Rockbreaker.

In the Kraylor society the Deathbringer is seen as flying fortress, since it packs a huge amount of beam weapons in the front. Everybody knows that taking it head-on is suicide. But the corrosive hull plating, the small blind spots and its really slow maneuvering may give nimble pilots a chance to cause serious damage.]])
